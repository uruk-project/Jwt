## Read & validate tokens
Token validation includes:
* signature verification
* expiration time 
* issuer presence & validity
* audience presence & validity

Tokens used in this benchmarks have from 6 to 96 claims.

**Note:** JsonWebToken, Wilson & Wilson JWT propose signature and standard claims validation. Jwt.Net only propose signature validation. jose-jwt does not propose any validation.

### Read & validate signed JWT (HS256)
![JWS validation, operation per second. Higher is better.](docs/validate_jws_ops.png)
*JWS validation, operation per second. Higher is better.*

![JWS validation, allocated bytes per operation. Lower is better.](docs/validate_jws_allocated.png)
*JWS validation, allocated bytes per operation. Lower is better.*

### Read & validate encrypted JWT (A128CBC-HS256 & A128KW, with HS256 signed JWT)
![JWE validation, operation per second. Higher is better.](docs/validate_jwe_ops.png)
*JWE validation, operation per second. Higher is better.*

![JWE validation, allocated bytes per operation. Lower is better.](docs/validate_jwe_allocated.png)
*JWE validation, allocated bytes per operation. Lower is better.*

### Read & validate encrypted and compressed JWT (A128CBC-HS256 & A128KW, with HS256 signed JWT, deflate compression)
![JWE compressed validation, operation per second. Higher is better.](docs/validate_jwec_ops.png)
*JWE compressed validation, operation per second. Higher is better.*

![JWE compressed validation, allocated bytes per operation. Lower is better.](docs/validate_jwec_allocated.png)
*JWE compressed validation, allocated bytes per operation. Lower is better.*

### Read & validate invalid JWT
![Invalid JWS validation, operation per second. Higher is better.](docs/validate_jwsi_ops.png)
*Invalid JWS validation, operation per second. Higher is better.*

![Invalid JWS validation, allocated bytes per operation. Lower is better.](docs/validate_jwsi_allocated.png)
*Invalid JWS validation, allocated bytes per operation. Lower is better.*
*JsonWebToken allocation is too low compared to others library to be represented in this graph*

## Write tokens
Tokens used in this benchmarks have from 6 to 96 claims.

### Write signed JWT (HS256)
![JWS creation, operation per second. Higher is better.](docs/write_jws_ops.png)
*JWS creation, operation per second. Higher is better.*

![JWS creation, allocated bytes per operation. Lower is better.](docs/write_jws_allocated.png)
*JWS creation, allocated bytes per operation. Lower is better.*
*JsonWebToken allocation is too low compared to others library to be represented in this graph*

### Write encrypted JWT (A128CBC-HS256 & A128KW, with HS256 signed JWT)
![JWE creation, operation per second. Higher is better.](docs/write_jwe_ops.png)
_JWE creation, operation per second. Higher is better._

![JWE creation, allocated bytes per operation. Lower is better.](docs/write_jwe_allocated.png)

*JsonWebToken allocation is too low compared to others library to be represented in this graph*

### Write encrypted and compressed JWT (A128CBC-HS256 & A128KW, with HS256 signed JWT, deflate compression)
![JWE compressed creation, operation per second. Higher is better.](docs/write_jwec_ops.png)
